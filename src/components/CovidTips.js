                To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
                </p>
                <p>
                 - Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they dont appear to be sick.
                </p>
                <p>
                 - Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                 - Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
                </p>
                <p>
                 - Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
                </p>
                <p>
                 - Get vaccinated when its your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
                </p>
                <p>
                 - Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
                </p>
                <p>
                 - Stay home if you feel unwell.
